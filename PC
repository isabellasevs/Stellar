Our Discord bot stores certain Channel IDs, User IDs and Message IDs in order for most of it's features to function.

These values are only read by the bot itself and not accessed by our team unless given permission to.
‚Äç
These values are publicly available, meaning we do NOT store any sensitive information of yours. Not only that, but we also do not store Message Content itself, rather forward it to different channels when needed (for our starboard and phone channel features).

To opt out of this, simply disable your features. By running any feature disable command all data associated with it will be deleted. This also means that we CANNOT recover any lost data, if you are planning on disabling features use caution.
